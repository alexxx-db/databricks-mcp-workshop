# Prototyping with Confidence on Databricks - Dependencies
# NOTE: Databricks CLI should be installed separately via:
#   - macOS/Linux: https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/install.html
#   - The setup script expects the modern CLI (v0.200+) to be available in PATH
#   - DO NOT install databricks-cli via pip as it's the deprecated Python version

# Development and testing tools
python-terraform>=0.10.1

# Optional: Additional utilities
requests>=2.31.0
pyyaml>=6.0
